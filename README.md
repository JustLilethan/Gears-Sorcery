For this Modjam, we decided to create a mod that brings Golemancy into Hytale.

Features: 

New Summonables - Runeforge Golem and Runeforge Turret with 3 different tiers each

New Weapons - Runeforge Hammers T1-T3 | You can use E to summon the Golem and R to summon the Turret

New Bench - Transmutation Table | You can Transmute Iron, Gold, and Copper Ingots to create Runic Ingots.

New Material - Runic Ingots | Created from Transmutation

New Blocks - Runeforge Core and Unpowered Runeforge Core

Guide:

To start, you will need to craft a Transmutation Table, which you craft in the Workbench. You'll need to gather Copper, Gold, and Iron to transmute the ingots into Runic Ingots. From here, you will take 20 Runic Ingots and 20 Ash Logs to make the Unpowered Runeforge Core. From here you will then need to power the core in an Arcanist Table using Greater Life Essence. Once you have done this you'll use the Weapon Anvil to finally craft your Runeforge Hammer.
